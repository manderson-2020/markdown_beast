## Getting Started

* get the code from github
* get a 3.8.x version of Python
* install `poetry`: https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation
    * Be sure to use the latest install (as is linked above)
* Install the dependencies: `poetry install`
    * I set the config to install a `.venv` local to the project: `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
* run some code: `poetry run python do_stuff.py`
